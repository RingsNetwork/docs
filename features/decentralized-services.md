Rings Network enables users to integrate services into its decentralized network. Its underlying mechanism relies on Rings DHT for service registration and discovery. Setting up hidden services is a straightforward process that decentralizes any service with just a few simple steps.

## Understand de-service

For classic Internet architecture, "services" typically refer to centralized services and entities. However, by using a Rings network, it is possible to effectively transform those centralized services into decentralized services.

This is achieved through a Rings custom backend. By configuring the Rings network to act as a transparent forwarder, all messages directed towards a registered service will ultimately be processed by this custom backend handler.

### Register of de-service

Every de-service provider can register itself in the network. The Rings network will create a key-value pair for each service in the form of `hash(services_name): [services_provider_did]` and store it using the DHT (Distributed Hash Table) feature across the network. When other network nodes request a de-service, this traffic will be forwarded to the corresponding active node providing that service.

### Querying of de-service

De-services can declare themselves as "alive" by using polling. This will help them maintain a relatively higher position in the de-service provider list. When a requester needs to request a de-service, it should first use the "service lookup" command to find the nodes that provide the required service:

```
rings service lookup --help
Usage: rings service lookup [OPTIONS] <NAME>

Arguments:
  <NAME>

Options:
  -u, --endpoint-url <ENDPOINT_URL>  rings-node endpoint url. If not provided, use endpoint_url in config file or http://127.0.0.1:50000 [env: ENDPOINT_URL=]
  -k, --key <ECDSA_KEY>              Your ECDSA key. If not provided, use ECDSA_KEY in env or ecdsa_key in config file [env: ECDSA_KEY=]
  -c, --config <CONFIG>              Config file location [env: CONFIG=] [default: ~/.rings/config.yaml]
  -h, --help                         Print help
```

This command can also be accomplished through the JSON-RPC API.

```
## Replace YOUR-SIGNATURE with your signature
## Replace NAME with the service name what you want to lookup in rings network
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-SIGNATURE: YOUR-SIGNATURE" \
--data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "lookupService", "params": ["NAME"]}' \
"http://127.0.0.1:50000"
```

It will return a provider list of de-service, and then you can use the elements in the list to request de-services.

### Request de-services

Rings CLI provides a set of tools to assist in requesting de-services. This can be accomplished through the command line or via our Curl API.

For command-line usage:

```
rings send http --help
Sends an HTTP request message.

Usage: rings send http [OPTIONS] <TO_DID> <NAME> [PATH]

Arguments:
  <TO_DID>
  <NAME>
  [PATH]    [default: /]

Options:
  -u, --endpoint-url <ENDPOINT_URL>  rings-node endpoint url. If not provided, use endpoint_url in config file or http://127.0.0.1:50000 [env: ENDPOINT_URL=]
  -k, --key <ECDSA_KEY>              Your ECDSA key. If not provided, use ECDSA_KEY in env or ecdsa_key in config file [env: ECDSA_KEY=]
  -c, --config <CONFIG>              Config file location [env: CONFIG=] [default: ~/.rings/config.yaml]
  -X, --method <METHOD>              request method [default: get]
  -H, --header <HEADERS>             headers append to the request
  -b, --body <BODY>                  set content of http body
      --timeout <TIMEOUT>            [default: 30000]
  -h, --help                         Print help
```

For curl (JSON-RPC) usage

```
## Replace YOUR-SIGNATURE with your signature
## Replace REMOTE-PEER-DID with did of remote peer
## Replace HTTP-REQUEST-ARG with your request arguments
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-SIGNATURE: YOUR-SIGNATURE" \
--data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "sendSimpleTextMessage", "params": ["REMOTE-PEER-DID", {HTTP-REQUEST-ARG}]}' \
"http://127.0.0.1:50000"
```

## Backend&#x20;

Backends can be classified into various types based on different transmission protocols, such as TCP-Backend, HTTP-Backend, and WASM-Backend. The essence of a backend is that it acts as a custom message handler. It must have a service name and a delegated service path.

For example, we can declare a backend service with the name "ipfs\_provider." This service will redirect all requests directed towards its name to a configured prefix handler, which, in our example, is [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).

Thus, our config.yaml can be looks like this:

### Config your backend

Rings allows users to configure hidden services through the "config.yaml" file. If you are not familiar with what "config.yaml" is, I recommend reading up on it.

[config.yaml.md](../advanced-topic/config.yaml.md "mention")

For a hidden service, three fields need to be provided: "name," "register\_service," and "prefix". For example:

```yaml
- name: ipfs
  register_service: ipfs_provider
  prefix: http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

This config will perform two tasks:

1. It will use the "register\_service" function to register itself as an "ipfs\_provider" within the Rings Network.
2. It will forward all incoming traffic from the Rings Network to the specified "prefix."

Now let's integrate it into the `config.yaml` file:

```bash
# cat ./config.yaml

bind: 127.0.0.1:50000
endpoint_url: http://127.0.0.1:50000
ecdsa_key: <your private key>
ice_servers: stun://stun.l.google.com:19302
stabilize_timeout: 3
external_ip: null
backend:
- name: ipfs
  register_service: ipfs_provider
  prefix: http://127.0.0.1:8080
...
```

Once all the configurations are set up, you can use the command `rings run` to start hosting your decentralized services.
