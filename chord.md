# DHT

The Rings Network leverages the Chord algorithm for its lookup protocol, which allows for the efficient and scalable mapping of network participants. The network is organized as a ring topology, where each node is linked to two other nodes, maximizing the functionality of the Chord algorithm for quick and effective participant lookup and location.
