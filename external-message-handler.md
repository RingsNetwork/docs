# External message handler

Rings Network supports implementing an external message handler using any programming language. This can be achieved by providing a WebSocket endpoint.&#x20;

You can implement a custom message handler by creating your own WebSocket service and listening on `<endpoint>/ws`. This allows you to handle custom messages according to your specific requirements.
